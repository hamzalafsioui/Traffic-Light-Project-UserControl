# Traffic Light User Control Project
## Description
The Traffic Light User Control Project is a Windows Forms application designed to simulate the behavior of traffic lights using custom user controls. This project serves as a practical example of how to create and manage traffic light logic, including event handling for light changes and synchronization between multiple traffic lights.

## Features
* *Custom Traffic Light Controls:* Two independent traffic light controls with configurable delays for light transitions.
* *Event-Driven Light Management:* Events triggered on light changes to manage and synchronize traffic lights.
* *Realistic Traffic Light Timing:* Configurable delay before switching from green to orange for each traffic light.
* *Bidirectional Control:** Automatic switching of lights based on the state of the other traffic light.
## Implementation Details
* *Traffic Light Control:* Each traffic light is a custom user control with events for Red, Orange, and Green light changes.
* *Event Handlers:* Handlers for light change events to control and synchronize the two traffic lights.
* *Delay Configuration:* Different delay settings for the transition from green to orange for each traffic light to simulate realistic traffic light behavior.
* *Initialization and Start:** Initialization of traffic light controls and starting the simulation on form load.

## Requirements
* *Visual Studio:* For development and running the project.
* *.NET Framework:* Ensure you have the required .NET framework version installed.
